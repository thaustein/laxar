# Installing Third Party Widgets

Among [the advantages](../why_laxar.md) of using LaxarJS, the concept of isolated, reusable widgets was mentioned.
This begs the quetion, as to how can an existing LaxarJS widget can be added to your application.


## Installing Widgets Manually

Currently, widgets must be installed manually in three steps, of which usually only the first is required.
There are plans to add an automated bower-based installation process in the future.


### 1. Obtain the Widget

New widgets have to be installed into a sub-folder of `includes/widgets/` just like any widgets that you create yourself.
Usually, you will simply clone the required widgets from a git repository.

The recommended way to do this is using `git submodule add`:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/laxarjs/ax-headline-widget.git includes/widgets/laxarjs/ax-headline-widget.git
```

Instead of using git, you can also copy the widget from somewhere, unpack it from a zip archive or obtain it in any other way.
You just have to make sure that the widget's files are located under `includes/widgets/<package path>`, where the package path is given by the widget's `bower.json` (specifically by the `name` field).
In the example, the package path is `laxarjs/ax-headline-widget`.


### 2. Obtain the Dependencies

Some widgets have extra dependencies that should be listed in the `dependencies` section of the `bower.json` file.
You should compare your widget's bower dependencies to those of your application, adding missing dependencies.
Usually, you can automate that process using `bower` itself:

```sh
bower install --save ./includes/widgets/category/widget`
```

This will also install the widget itself as a bower component, which is not needed but also should not hurt.

### 3. Configure Paths for RequireJS

This is only relevant if your widget has its own bower-dependencies (step 2):
The _Installation_ section of your widget should tell you if any changes need to be made to your RequireJS configuration.
Usually, you will need to ensure that all bower-dependencies have a corresponding require path configuration.



## Installing Widgets Manually

This is still in the works: for LaxarJS v1.0, we plan to automate all three steps, possibly using `bower` and [bower-requirejs](https://github.com/yeoman/bower-requirejs).
